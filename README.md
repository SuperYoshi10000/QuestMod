# Quest Mod
This mod adds quests to Minecraft. Anyone in a world or on a server is able to complete them.

This mod is required on the server. It is not required on the client, though this has not been tested and it is more convenient to have it on both sides.

## Quests
The quest targets and rewards are randomly generated, and they get harder the longer the world has been played. There are many possible quests.

To see active quests, press `y` to open the quest list.
Each quest will have a claim button, which will only be clickable if you have completed the quest.
You can also click "claim all" to claim all quests that you have completed.

## Customization
Quests and quest lists can be customized with data packs. Every quest is based on a stat or other scoreboard criterion.

To customize quests, create a data pack quest lists in the directory `data/<namespace>/quests/`. For more information, see [DATAPACK.md](DATAPACK.md)
