# Quest Mod
This mod adds quests to Minecraft. Anyone in a world or on a server is able to complete them.

## Quests
The quest targets and rewards are randomly generated, and they get harder the longer the world has been played. There are many possible quests.

## Customization
Quests and quest lists can be customized with data packs. Every quest is based on a stat or other scoreboard criterion.
